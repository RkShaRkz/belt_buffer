# belt_buffer
A buffer for your belts

A fixed-up and maintained version of klonan's belt buffer mod (https://github.com/Klonan/belt_buffer) which he seems to have abandoned.

Works fine on v18 with a bit of side touchups/improvements like a mod setting that lets you customize the buffer capacity.
PRs and forks are welcome.
